Now i will explain, why i just divided the adc value by 10 instead of doing what i have written in the first line of this section. So lets understand all this, step by step:
We get digital value of the analog signal and let's say it is stored in ADC_DATA variable.
Next step is to convert this digital value in voltage.
Analog Value Sensed by PIC,
ANALOG_VALUE_PIC = (Reference Voltage*ADC_DATA)/(2^10)
ANALOG_VALUE_PIC = (5*ADC_DATA)/(1024)
Reference Voltage in our case is 5V and we are using 10-bit ADC of PIC micro-controller, that's why 2^10 = 1024 is used.
ANALOG_VALUE = ANALOG_VALUE_PIC * 20
We multiplied by 20 because, we scale down the voltage by 20 as explained above.
ANALOG_VALUE = (5*20/1024)*ADC_DATA
So it's clear from the above expression, that we have (5*10/1024) as constant value, which is equivalent to = 0.098 and i rounded off this to 0.01 or (1/10), to make the calculation simple, with some error in the system.
Final Expression, ANALOG_VALUE = ADC_DATA/10
